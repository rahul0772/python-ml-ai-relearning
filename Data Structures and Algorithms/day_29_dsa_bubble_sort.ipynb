        "We want to sort a list of numbers from smallest to largest.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you have a set of cards with numbers written on them, and you want to arrange them in increasing order. The Bubble Sort method is like you looking at two cards at a time and swapping them if they are out of order.\n",

        "How Bubble Sort Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "We start with the first card and compare it with the next card.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the first card has a bigger number than the second card, swap them. This way, the bigger number bubbles up to the right side of the list.\n",
        "\n",
        "After one complete round of looking at all pairs, the biggest card will be at the end.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next round will repeat the process, but we can ignore the last card since it's already in the right position.\n",
        "\n",
        "We keep repeating this until the list is completely sorted.\n",
        "\n",
        "Basic Example:\n",

        "Let's say you have a list of numbers: [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]\n",

        "\n",
        "Now, 8 is in its correct position at the end. We don't need to check it in the next pass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Second Pass:\n",
        "\n",
        "Compare 3 and 5. No swap needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compare 5 and 4. Since 5 is bigger, swap them. New list: [3, 4, 5, 2, 8].\n",

        "\n",
        "After the second pass, 5 is in its correct position at the second last spot. The next pass ignores 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "Third Pass:\n",
        "\n",
        "Compare 3 and 4. No swap needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compare 4 and 2. Since 4 is bigger, swap them. New list: [3, 2, 4, 5, 8].\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, 4 is in its correct position. We only need to check the first two elements for the final pass.\n",
