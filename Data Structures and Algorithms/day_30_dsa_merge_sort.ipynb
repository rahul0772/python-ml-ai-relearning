        "\n",
        "Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. The main idea is:\n",
        "\n",
        "Divide the list into two smaller sublists.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conquer by recursively sorting each sublist.\n",
        "\n",
        "Combine the two sorted sublists back together in sorted order.\n",
        "\n",
        "It works by breaking the problem down into smaller and easier problems and then combining the results in the correct order.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "Recursion: The function calls itself to solve smaller versions of the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Merging: The sorted sublists are merged back together in a way that ensures the combined list is sorted.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step-by-Step Walkthrough Without Code Example:\n",
        "1. Divide the Array:\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you have a big list of numbers that you want to sort.\n",
        "\n",
        "To sort the list, we first split it into two equal halves. If the list has an odd number of elements, one of the halves will have one extra element.\n",
        "\n",
        "You keep splitting the list into halves until you reach individual elements, which are inherently sorted since there is only one element.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Original list: [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]\n",
        "\n",
        "First split: [38, 27, 43] and [3, 9, 82, 10]\n",
        "\n",
        "Second split: [38], [27, 43] and [3, 9], [82, 10]\n",
        "\n",
        "Continue splitting until each list has only one element:\n",

        "\n",
        "Once we reach individual elements, they are \"sorted\" because there is only one element.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now we start combining these individual elements back together, but while combining, we make sure the elements are in the correct order. This is called merging.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Merge Sorted Sublists:\n",
        "\n",
        "To merge two sorted sublists, we compare the elements at the front of each list.\n",
        "\n",
        "The smaller of the two elements is added to the new merged list, and we move the pointer of that list to the next element.\n",
        "\n",
        "We continue this process until we have combined both lists into one sorted list.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of merging two lists:\n",

        "Left list: [27, 43]\n",

        "Right list: [3, 9]\n",
        "\n",
        "Merging:\n",
        "\n",
        "Compare 27 and 3 → 3 is smaller, so it goes into the merged list.\n",

        "\n",

        "The left half is the part before mid (from index 0 to mid-1).\n",
        "\n",
        "The right half is the part after mid (from index mid to the end of the list).\n",
        "\n",
        "Recursive Sorting:\n",
        "\n",
        "We call merge_sort on the left half (left_sorted = merge_sort(left_half)) and the right half (right_sorted = merge_sort(right_half)).\n",
        "\n",
        "This step keeps dividing the array into smaller arrays until we reach arrays of size 1 or 0 (base case).\n",

        "The merge function is responsible for combining two sorted arrays (left and right).\n",
