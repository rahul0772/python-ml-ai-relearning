        "\n",
        "# Key Concepts:\n",
        "# 1. **File Opening Modes**:\n",
        "#    - \"w\" -> write mode (creates or overwrites a file).\n",
        "#    - \"r\" -> read mode (opens the file for reading only).\n",
        "# 2. **with open()**: Ensures proper handling of files. You don’t need to manually close the file; it's done automatically after the block is completed.\n",
        "# 3. **file.write()**: Writes data to the file.\n",
        "# 4. **file.read()**: Reads the entire content of the file into a string.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example of the file content before and after running the code:\n",
        "# Before: The file is empty or doesn't exist.\n",
        "# After: The file contains:\n",
        "# Hello, world!\n",
        "# This is a file."
